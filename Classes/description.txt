[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod] As some people may notice, what I tried to reproduce here are the ninja abilities given by the ninja equipments in Terraria ^^
Nothing too hard to code this time: the dash simply makes you really fast for a split second. The air-unragdoll is a custom StandUp() function without some checks that forced the player to be on the floor to unragdoll. The infinite wallrun is made by making your vertical movement only positive or null when you wallrun.
The only thing that I was not able to implement is the ability to stick to walls, for some reasons you can't start to wallrun when falling and that makes things a bit complicated...
